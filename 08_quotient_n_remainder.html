	<!-- QUESTION 8 :Write program segments that accomplish each of the following tasks:

	a. Calculate the integer part of the quotient when integer a is divided by integer

	b. Calculate the integer remainder when integer a is divided by integer b.

	Then, use the programpieces developed in parts (a) and (b) to write a function displayDigits that receives an integer between 1 and 99999 and prints it as a series of digits, each pair of which is separated by two spaces.
	For example, the integer 4562 should be printed as 4 5 6 2-->

	<script type="text/javascript">
		var input = prompt("Enter a number between 1 and 99999","1");
		document.write("<pre>");
		displayDigits(parseInt(input));
		document.write("</pre>");

		// Part A
		function quotient(a,b) 
		{
			return Math.floor(a/b);
		}

		// Part B
		function remainder(a,b) 
		{
			return a % b;
		}

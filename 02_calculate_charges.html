	<!-- QUESTION 2 : A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours. The garage charges an additional $0.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof in excess of three hours. The maximum charge for any given 24-­‐hour period is $10.00. Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours at a time.
	Write a script that calculates and displays the parking charges for each customer who parked a car in
	this garage yesterday. You should input from the user the hours parked for each customer. The program
	should display the charge for the current customer and should calculate and display the running total of yesterday's receipts. The program should use the function calculate-­‐Charges to determine the charge
	for each customer. Use a text input field to obtain the input from the user.-->

	<script type="text/javascript">

		//Get input from a user
		function parkingFee()
		{

			// Ask user to input parking hours
			var parkingHours = parseFloat(prompt("How many hours you have parked today?"));


			//  0 to 3 hrs - $2.00 / hr
			if (parkingHours <= 3.0 && parkingHours > 0.0) 
				{
				var fee = 2.0;
				document.write("Total charges is " + fee * parkingHours);
				}
			
			// 4 to 24 hrs - $0.5 / additional hr
			else if (parkingHours > 3.0 && parkingHours <= 24.0)
				{
				 var fee2 = (parkingHours-3.0)*0.5+6;

				 document.write("Total charges is " + fee2);

				}
			
			// more than 24 hrs / max. charge
			else if (parkingHours > 24.0)
				{
				var fee3 = 10.0;
				document.write("Total charges is " + fee3);
				}		
		}
